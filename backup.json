As with the kahikatea in the wetland, these kauri were planted amongst a nurse crop, only this time kanuka was used as opposed to manuka. As you can see, they have grown so much in such a short space of time. Kauri need light to grow, and in the early years grow quickly in order for the crowns to reach above the canopy. The kanuka is slowly dying off leaving a canopy of kauri in its place. These trees are part of a research project and are monitored and measured periodically to better understand growth habits of planted kauri. It is a misconception that native trees grow slowly. In fact if the right tree is planted in the right place, growth can be rapid, as is demonstrated here with the kauri.

The titoki forms a round-headed tree with deep green glossy foliage. The unusual small red fruits are a food source for Kererū and other native birds. Titoki leaves and oil have been used as an insect repellent to ward off mosquito and sandflies. Early settlers perhaps dreaming of English forests often referred to titoki as the New Zealand oak. Titoki have been used extensively as street trees but make a bold evergreen shade tree in the garden. Titoki respond well to trimming and shaping and can be used as a pleached or stilt hedge or as large topiary subjects. Titoki thrive in well-drained soil. They should be staked until established and would benefit from a deep layer of mulch to keep the roots cool and moist during dry spells.","Location":"Hilltop","Picture":"images/Alectryon excelsus subsp. excelsus.JPG","Name":"Titoki or NZ Ash","__collections__":{}},"139Tōtara":{"StructuralClass":"Trees & Shrubs - Gymnosperms","Authority":"Podocarpus Totara var.

Easily grown from fresh seed (seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed), emergent shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. Very hardy and will tolerate most soils and moisture regimes but dislikes long periods of drought. Excellent in pots and tubs.   Cabbage trees, because they are very resilient, are often the last indigenous plant to persist within cleared land. However, even these specimens will over time die, and unless such remnants are fenced as the young seedlings are greedily eaten by livestock. Cabbage trees remain a common and thriving species within much of the more highly modified ecosystems of coastal and lowland New Zealand.","__collections__":{}},"Pomaderris Kumaraho":{"StructuralClass":"Trees & Shrubs - Dicotyledons","Authority":"Pomaderris Kumaraho","Narrative":"","Picture":"images/Pomaderris kumeraho (BOP, Athenree Gorge).JPG","Conservation":"2012 - Non Threatened","Family":"Rhamnaceae","NVS":"POMKUM","Location":"Nursery","Name":"Pale Flowered Kumarahou (Pomaderris Hamiltonii)","__collections__":{}},"Prumnopitys Taxifolia ":{"StructuralClass":"Trees & Shrubs - Gymnosperms","Narrative":"Here we have matai, one of our forest giants.
